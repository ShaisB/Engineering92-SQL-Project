## Engineering92-SQL-Project  

# The Basics  

In week 2 of my training with Sparta Global, we covered SQL. This included using Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML). This project used DML commands in Exercises 1 and 3, and DDL commands in Exercise 2.  

# Manipulation of tables  

As all of the data was split between tables, different JOIN commands were needed to combine data to get the required information. This is used extensively throughout the project, most commonly INNER JOIN commands however where certain data was needed to be preserved a LEFT JOIN or RIGHT JOIN was required.  
Once all the required data was connected, constraint commands such as WHERE and HAVING were used to filter out unnecessary rows. ORDER and GROUP BY were also used to ensure the data was presented in the desired format.
